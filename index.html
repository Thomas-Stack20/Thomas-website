     <p>Hey, My name is Thomas and I just wanted to showcase my favorite strength training Excersices and why I do them</p>

     <p>this Excersice above is the Push-up.The Push-up is a compound Excersice that works the chest,anterior deltoid and triceps, I like doing Push-ups because it's a classic Excersice that everyone can do and also there are so many different variations you can do</p>
         <img src="https://standupbestrong.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Barbell-Row-exercise.jpg" alt="Barbell-Row-exercise">
        <p>this Excersice is the barbell row, The Barbell row is a compound excersice that works the lattissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid, trapezius and bicep muscles. I like doing this exercise because its a compound movement that works all the muscles in the back</p>

        <p>this Excersice above is the Pull-up. The Pull-up is a compound excersice that works that lattissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid and biceps. The Pull-up mainly works the lattissimus dorsi muscle,the famous muscle that increases the V shape. I like doing this excersice because it's a classic excersice that tests your Upper body strength and it enhances the V shape.

        <p>this Excersice above is the incline dumbell press. The incline dumbell press is a compound movement that works the chest,anterior deltoid and triceps like the Push-up excersice but the incline dumbell press works more of the Upper chest. I like this excersice because it builds the upper chest which can be a very lagging muscle for a lot of people including myself.
